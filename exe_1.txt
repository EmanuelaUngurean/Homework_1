1. Exercise #1 : Finding defects
As we previously spoke on our last meeting, we identified that a defect can be described also by a severity and a priority. Please give 3 examples each, where:


- priority is high & severity is low
* Company name is misspelled on its website;
* The title of an application is misspelled in the magazin play;
* In the online shopping website, the frontpage logo is spelled wrong.


- priority is low & severity is high
* When user clicks on a link the web page is not found;
* An application crashes when a remote link is clicked;
* Customers who use very old browsers cannot continue with their purchase of a product (because the number of customers with very old browsers is very low, it is not a high priority to fix the issue).


- both are high
* On an eCommerce website, every customers get error message on the booking form and cannot place orders, or the product page throws a Error 500 response;
* A site maintaining the student details on saving record but it doesn't allow to save the record;
* The system crashes after you made the payment or when you are not able to add the items to the Cart.


- both are low
* The privacy policy page take a long time to load;
* The privacy policy of the website has a spelling mistake;
* Font size or color in the application or in reports.
