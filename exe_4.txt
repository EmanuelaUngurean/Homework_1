4. Exercise #4: Providing suggestions
Providing suggestion to improve quality or user experience is the extension of software testing job. So why not try that? 
Can you tell how user experience can be improved for the following sign in page?


How do I think that I should improve the user experience for him to log in that page?


First of all, I do not think that those questions like "What is your e-mail address?" or "Do you have password?" has to appear in that page because it is enough just to ask the users to introduce they data to logg in ( like e-mail and password ) and they will know what it is about, they will know what to write in that box. And also I do not find the necessity of the button ""Sign in using our secure server -> ".
 
I think that this can be an relevant example:
﻿
                 Sign in


      E-mail address: ______________________

      Password:       ______________________

                
      ☑️ Stay signed in
                
                   ❓️Forgotten your password?

            ➡️Create Account 

                                                 
       New user?
